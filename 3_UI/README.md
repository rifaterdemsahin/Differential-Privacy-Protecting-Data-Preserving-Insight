# 🧠 3_UI: Knowledge & Skill Acquisition

- **Premise:** Development is a journey of learning.
- **Content:** A personal knowledge base for concepts, theories, and skills.
- **Conclusion:** Fosters continuous improvement.

## 🎨 The User Interface
In this project, the **UI is the Notebook itself**, demonstrating differential privacy concepts interactively.

### Laplace Mechanism Section
-   **Markdown Cells**: Explain privacy through noise addition.
-   **Code Cells**: Compute private averages, counts.
-   **Visualizations**: Show noise distribution and privacy guarantees.

### DP-SGD Training Section
-   **Markdown Cells**: Explain gradient clipping and noise addition.
-   **Code Cells**: Implement per-sample gradient clipping.
-   **Visualizations**: Show gradient norms before/after clipping.

### Privacy Budget Analysis Section
-   **Markdown Cells**: Explain epsilon parameter and tradeoffs.
-   **Code Cells**: Train models with different epsilon values.
-   **Visualizations**: Plot privacy-utility tradeoff curves.

### Membership Inference Section
-   **Markdown Cells**: Explain privacy attacks and defenses.
-   **Code Cells**: Test if attacker can detect training membership.
-   **Visualizations**: Compare attack success on private vs non-private models.

### Interactive Elements
-   Privacy budget sliders (epsilon values)
-   Noise visualization with different noise scales
-   Side-by-side accuracy comparison (private vs non-private)
-   Privacy guarantee verification plots
