# 💻 5_Symbols: Implementation & Code

- **Premise:** Where theory becomes reality.
- **Content:** The core application source code (Jupyter Notebook).
- **Conclusion:** The heart of the project.

## 🔑 The Code
This folder contains the core implementation artifact:

### [differential_privacy_demo.ipynb](differential_privacy_demo.ipynb)
The Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the full differential privacy framework:
1.  **Conceptual Introduction**: Privacy through noise
2.  **Laplace Mechanism**: Private statistics (average, count)
3.  **Privacy Guarantee Verification**: Mathematical proof demonstration
4.  **Baseline Model**: Standard training without privacy
5.  **DP-SGD Implementation**: Private model training
6.  **Gradient Clipping**: Per-sample gradient norm clipping
7.  **Noise Addition**: Gaussian noise for privacy
8.  **Privacy Budget Analysis**: Different epsilon values
9.  **Privacy-Utility Tradeoff**: Accuracy vs privacy curves
10. **Membership Inference**: Attack resistance testing
11. **Real-World Example**: Census-style aggregate statistics
